● What is prop drilling? // nesteing components to pass props leads to props dealing
● What is lifting the state up? // controlling state of multiple childrens from parent (open and close accordion)

Coding:
● Practice React Context with code examples
● Try out Nested Contexts
References:
● Lifting State Up
